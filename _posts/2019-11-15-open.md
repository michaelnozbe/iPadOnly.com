title: "The #iPadOnly book project goes open source!"
---

We're going open source! [Initially launched in 2013](/launch) the #iPadOnly book is no longer as relevant as it used to be, but many concepts from this book still hold true now as they did then.

That's why both authors [Augusto Pinaud and Michael Sliwinski](/about) decided to [put the entire contents of the book to GitHub](https://github.com/michaelnozbe/iPadOnly.com) as well as [on this site](/book) and license it under [Creative Commons Share-Alike license](/license).

They both will update the book, change its contents and accept "pull requests" from anyone who wants to contribute. Let's write the #iPadOnly book together!
