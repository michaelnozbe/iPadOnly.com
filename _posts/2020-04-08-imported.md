title: "To celebrate iPad's 10th anniversary the #iPadOnly book is finally imported and ready for you to read online for free!"
---

As we announced that the [#iPadOnly book](/book) would be free and [open sourced](/open) I didn't have the time to finally dig out the old manuscript and import it until today.

As iPad celebrates 10th anniversary I thought it'd be great to finally have the entire book published. There are still a few quirks to iron out on this web site. I also want to add the original illustrations (done by me in Paper on iPad), but this can come later.

### The [book is published](/book/) and you can now [start reading](/book/intro/).

Enjoy!
