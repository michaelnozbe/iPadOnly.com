## About the #iPadOnly authors

### AUGUSTO PINAUD

Augusto Pinaud is a writer, a public speaker and a BestSeller Author in the US, UK, Germany, Spain and France. In another life he was a lawyer in recovery and a former technology consultant and salesman. His passion is to write. He's been studying productivity and helping people with getting organized for the last ten years.

Augusto lives in the USA. He is married and has a little girl, a boy and two dogs who keep him company. He spends his day teaching his daughter and son things, writing and washing dishes, because he believes in what Agatha Christie once said: "The best time for planning a book is while you're doing the dishes."
