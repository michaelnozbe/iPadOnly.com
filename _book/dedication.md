## Augusto:

> To Alicia & Tomas who have a chance to understand #iPadOnly as children and most likely in a way that I never will. 
 
## Michael:

> To my three daughters: Milena - the first completely #iPadOnly person I got to know, Emilia - who's becoming a true #iPadOnly artist and the youngest - Liliana - who's rocking my first 2010 iPad. Finally, to my wife - Ewelina - the prettiest #iPadOnly geek I know.
