subtitle: We dedicate this book to our families

Augusto: To Alicia & Tomas who have a chance to understand #iPadOnly as children and most likely in a way that I never will. 
 
Michael: To my 4-year old daughter - Milena - the first #iPadOnly person I got to know. To my younger daughter - Emilia - who inevitably will be #iPadOnly soon. Finally, to my wife - Ewelina - the prettiest #iPadOnly geek I know.
